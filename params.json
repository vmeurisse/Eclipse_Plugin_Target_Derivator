{"name":"Eclipse plugin target derivator","tagline":"Eclipse plugin to mark maven target folders as derived resources","body":"This Eclipse plugin (developped on Eclipse 3.7.1) is for Maven users who want to mark the target folders as derived resources.\r\nThe point is to hide the derived resources when searching for resources (with i.e. Ctrl+Shift+R). After a mvn clean, the target\r\nfolders are recreated, and the plugin will help to mark these new folders as derivated.\r\n\r\nTo install the plugin, copy the latest jar-file under plugins/ to your Eclipse plugins/ folder. Restart Eclipse.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
